		<h1>Chennai Reading</h1>
		<div>
			<b>Who we are:</b>
			<p>A bunch of people (mostly not based in Chennai) interested in education in India and particularly in Chennai. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>What is our aim:</b>
			<p>To improve reading level/critical thinking skills of children through story books. Our current goal is to ensure that all children going through our program improve their reading significantly. Our larger goal is to create a reading movement in Chennai with every child reading well!</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Is this program needed in the school?</b>
			<p>We found that approximately 30/110 students in the school are reading very much below Class 6 level. We feel this is a sufficiently high number to warrant this program.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>What we are doing:</b>
			<ol>
				<li>
					We have started a Tamil reading program for class 6 students at:
					<blockquote>
						25,Minister Govindaswamy St. <br/>
						MGR Nagar, Chennai- 78.<br/>
						(Behind MGR Nagar Market, near KK Nagar).<br/>
					</blockquote>
				</li>
				<li>
					The program was designed based on inputs from two NGO&#39;s - Hippocampus Reading Foundation (<a href="http://blog.hippocampus.in/" target="_blank">http://blog.hippocampus.in/</a>) , Bangalore and Reading Partners, USA (<a href="http://readingpartners.org/" target="_blank">http://readingpartners.org/</a>).
				</li>
				<li>
					Timings: Tuesday through Friday, 3 PM to 4PM. 2 Batches of 15 students each. First batch tue and wed. Second batch - thur and fri.
				</li>
				<li>
					The librarian (Amudha) at the school has currently been&nbsp;<i>hired</i>&nbsp;as the tutor. We also have another person (Hema of Aid India) who visits twice a month to do some broad monitoring.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each class consists of model reading by the tutor, independent reading by the children. The children are encouraged to take books home.&nbsp;
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>What we are looking for :</b>		
			<ol>
				<li>
					A community of interested/committed people who can help us build momentum for a reading movement in Chennai.
				</li>
				<li>
					Volunteers on the ground in Chennai who can go to the school at the times mentioned and help the tutor with data collection, reading to children and substituting the tutor when she is absent.
